# Inverse-Overlapping-FVGs
Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) in ICT's technical analysis theory refer to price discrepancies between candles where the wicks of surrounding candles fail to encompass the entire range of a central candle, suggesting potential inefficiencies in market valuation.
This cAlgo indicator visualises these inefficiencies in assets which are inversed (bullish and bearish) and overlap one another.
